## stochastic processes

A collection of Monte Carlo toy models of stochastic processes.

During my undergraduate studies, I became fascinated with random processes and statistical physics, perhaps owing to the relative simplicity of Monte Carlo simulations yielding non-trivial physical results.
Besides, watching a random walk can be mesmerizing.

At the time, my standard workflow with numerical calculations was:
- C/C++ implementation (no GUI)
- plotting output data in gnuplot

Sometimes, I wanted an interactive visualization of the model.
In such cases, I would use HTML canvas and JavaScript implementation of the simulation.
